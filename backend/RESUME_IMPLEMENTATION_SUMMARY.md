# Resume Model Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

The Resume model has been successfully implemented and integrated with the User model via a foreign key relationship. Each user can now have one or more resumes associated with their account.

## üèóÔ∏è What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Model (`app/models/resume.py`)
- **Resume Model**: Complete SQLAlchemy model with comprehensive fields
- **Foreign Key**: `user_id` field linking to User model with CASCADE delete
- **One-to-Many Relationship**: Each user can have multiple resumes
- **File Management**: Support for PDF, DOC, DOCX, and TXT files
- **Content Storage**: Skills, languages, experience, education tracking
- **Status Management**: Active/inactive and public/private settings
- **Audit Trail**: Created/updated timestamps and analysis tracking

### 2. Pydantic Schemas (`app/schemas/resume.py`)
- **ResumeCreate**: For creating new resumes
- **ResumeUpdate**: For updating existing resumes
- **ResumeRead**: For reading resume data
- **ResumeResponse**: For API responses
- **ResumeListResponse**: For paginated lists
- **ResumeFileUpload**: For file upload operations
- **ResumeAnalysisRequest**: For analysis requests

### 3. API Endpoints (`app/api/resume.py`)
- **POST /api/v1/resumes/**: Create resume
- **GET /api/v1/resumes/**: List user's resumes (paginated)
- **GET /api/v1/resumes/{id}**: Get specific resume
- **PUT /api/v1/resumes/{id}**: Update resume
- **DELETE /api/v1/resumes/{id}**: Delete resume
- **POST /api/v1/resumes/{id}/upload**: Upload file
- **GET /api/v1/resumes/{id}/download**: Download file
- **POST /api/v1/resumes/{id}/analyze**: Analyze resume
- **GET /api/v1/resumes/public/{id}**: Get public resume
- **GET /api/v1/resumes/stats/summary**: Get resume statistics

### 4. Integration Updates
- **main.py**: Added resume router to FastAPI app
- **User Model**: Already had resume relationship defined
- **Database**: Resume table created with proper foreign key constraints

## üîó Database Relationships

### User ‚Üî Resume Relationship
```python
# In User model
resumes: Mapped[List["Resume"]] = relationship(
    "Resume", 
    back_populates="user", 
    cascade="all, delete-orphan"
)

# In Resume model
user_id: Mapped[uuid.UUID] = mapped_column(
    UUID(as_uuid=True), 
    ForeignKey("users.id", ondelete="CASCADE"), 
    nullable=False
)
user: Mapped["User"] = relationship("User", back_populates="resumes")
```

## üìä Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE resumes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    file_path VARCHAR(500),
    file_name VARCHAR(255),
    file_size INTEGER,
    file_type VARCHAR(50),
    summary TEXT,
    experience_years FLOAT,
    education_level VARCHAR(100),
    skills TEXT,  -- JSON string
    languages TEXT,  -- JSON string
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    last_analyzed TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

## üß™ Testing Results

All tests passed successfully:
- ‚úÖ Resume model creation and relationships
- ‚úÖ Foreign key constraints working
- ‚úÖ One-to-many relationship (User ‚Üí Resumes)
- ‚úÖ Skills and languages JSON storage
- ‚úÖ File management capabilities
- ‚úÖ Pydantic schema validation
- ‚úÖ CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ User-resume relationship queries

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. **Multiple Resumes Per User**
- Each user can have unlimited resumes
- Each resume is linked to exactly one user
- User deletion cascades to resume deletion

### 2. **File Management**
- Support for multiple file types (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT)
- File size validation (10MB max)
- Secure file storage with UUID-based naming
- File download and upload endpoints

### 3. **Content Management**
- Skills stored as JSON array
- Languages stored as JSON with proficiency levels
- Experience years tracking
- Education level tracking
- Resume summary/objective

### 4. **Status Management**
- Active/inactive status for resumes
- Public/private visibility settings
- Analysis tracking and timestamps

### 5. **API Features**
- Full CRUD operations
- Pagination and filtering
- File upload/download
- Resume analysis endpoints
- Public resume sharing
- Statistics and reporting

## üîí Security Features

- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require user authentication
- **Authorization**: Users can only access their own resumes
- **File Validation**: File type and size validation
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive Pydantic schema validation
- **SQL Injection Protection**: SQLAlchemy ORM prevents SQL injection

## üìà Performance Optimizations

- **Database Indexes**: Optimized queries with proper indexing
- **Pagination**: Efficient pagination for large resume lists
- **Lazy Loading**: Relationships loaded only when needed
- **File Streaming**: Efficient file upload/download

## üîÑ Integration Points

### 1. **User Management**
- Seamlessly integrated with existing user system
- Uses FastAPI-Users authentication
- Role-based access control ready

### 2. **Analysis System**
- Ready for AI analysis integration
- Analysis results can be stored in Score model
- Resume analysis tracking and history

### 3. **File System**
- Integrated file upload/download
- Secure file storage
- File cleanup on resume deletion

## üìù Usage Examples

### Create a Resume
```python
resume_data = ResumeCreate(
    title="Software Engineer Resume",
    summary="Experienced software engineer...",
    experience_years=5.5,
    education_level="Bachelor's Degree",
    skills=["Python", "JavaScript", "React"],
    languages=[{"name": "English", "proficiency": "Native"}],
    is_public=False
)
```

### Query User's Resumes
```python
# Get all resumes for a user
resumes = await db.execute(
    select(Resume).where(Resume.user_id == user_id)
)
```

### File Upload
```python
# Upload resume file
with open("resume.pdf", "rb") as file:
    response = await client.post(
        f"/api/v1/resumes/{resume_id}/upload",
        files={"file": file}
    )
```

## üéØ Next Steps

The Resume system is now fully functional and ready for:

1. **Frontend Integration**: Connect with React frontend
2. **AI Analysis**: Implement resume analysis algorithms
3. **File Processing**: Add resume parsing and content extraction
4. **Advanced Features**: Resume templates, versioning, etc.
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics and monitoring

## ‚úÖ Verification

The implementation has been thoroughly tested and verified:
- Database relationships working correctly
- API endpoints functioning properly
- File upload/download working
- User authentication and authorization working
- Data validation working
- Error handling working

The Resume system is production-ready and fully integrated with the existing AI Job Readiness platform.
