# Resume System Implementation

## Overview

The Resume system has been successfully implemented as part of the AI Job Readiness platform. It provides comprehensive resume management capabilities with a proper foreign key relationship to the User model, allowing each user to have multiple resumes associated with their account.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Model (`app/models/resume.py`)
- **Resume Model**: Complete SQLAlchemy model with all necessary fields
- **Foreign Key Relationship**: `user_id` field linking to User model
- **One-to-Many Relationship**: Each user can have multiple resumes
- **File Management**: Support for file uploads (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT)
- **Content Parsing**: Skills, languages, experience, and education tracking
- **Status Management**: Active/inactive and public/private settings
- **Audit Trail**: Created/updated timestamps
- **Analysis Integration**: Last analyzed timestamp and analysis status

### 2. Pydantic Schemas (`app/schemas/resume.py`)
- **ResumeCreate**: Schema for creating new resumes
- **ResumeUpdate**: Schema for updating existing resumes
- **ResumeRead**: Schema for reading resume data
- **ResumeResponse**: Schema for API responses
- **ResumeListResponse**: Schema for paginated resume lists
- **ResumeFileUpload**: Schema for file upload operations
- **ResumeAnalysisRequest**: Schema for analysis requests

### 3. API Endpoints (`app/api/resume.py`)
- **POST /resumes/**: Create a new resume
- **GET /resumes/**: List user's resumes with pagination and filtering
- **GET /resumes/{resume_id}**: Get specific resume details
- **PUT /resumes/{resume_id}**: Update existing resume
- **DELETE /resumes/{resume_id}**: Delete resume and associated files
- **POST /resumes/{resume_id}/upload**: Upload resume file
- **GET /resumes/{resume_id}/download**: Download resume file
- **POST /resumes/{resume_id}/analyze**: Analyze resume against job requirements
- **GET /resumes/public/{resume_id}**: Get public resume (no auth required)
- **GET /resumes/stats/summary**: Get resume statistics for user

### 4. User Model Integration (`app/models/user.py`)
- **Relationship Definition**: `resumes` relationship in User model
- **Cascade Operations**: Proper cascade delete for resume cleanup
- **Type Hints**: Full type annotation support

## Database Schema

### Resume Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE resumes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    file_path VARCHAR(500),
    file_name VARCHAR(255),
    file_size INTEGER,
    file_type VARCHAR(50),
    summary TEXT,
    experience_years FLOAT,
    education_level VARCHAR(100),
    skills TEXT,  -- JSON string
    languages TEXT,  -- JSON string
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    last_analyzed TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

### Indexes
- `ix_resumes_user_id`: For fast user-specific queries
- `ix_resumes_created_at`: For chronological ordering
- `ix_resumes_is_active`: For active status filtering
- `ix_resumes_file_type`: For file type filtering

## API Usage Examples

### 1. Create a Resume
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/resumes/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Software Engineer Resume",
    "summary": "Experienced software engineer with 5+ years in full-stack development",
    "experience_years": 5.5,
    "education_level": "Bachelor'\''s Degree",
    "skills": ["Python", "JavaScript", "React", "Node.js", "PostgreSQL"],
    "languages": [
      {"name": "English", "proficiency": "Native"},
      {"name": "Spanish", "proficiency": "Intermediate"}
    ],
    "is_public": false
  }'
```

### 2. List User's Resumes
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/resumes/?page=1&size=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 3. Upload Resume File
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/resumes/1/upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@resume.pdf"
```

### 4. Analyze Resume
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/resumes/1/analyze" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer",
    "company": "Tech Corp",
    "job_description": "We are looking for a senior software engineer..."
  }'
```

## File Management

### Supported File Types
- PDF (.pdf)

- Plain Text (.txt)

### File Storage
- Files are stored in `uploads/resumes/` directory
- Unique filenames generated using UUID
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Automatic file cleanup on resume deletion

## Security Features

### Test Script
Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
cd backend
python test_resume_system.py
```

### Test Coverage

## Integration Points

### 1. User Management
- Resumes are automatically linked to users
- User deletion cascades to resume deletion
- User authentication required for most operations

### 2. Role-Based Access

- Admin users can potentially access all resumes
- Public resume sharing for non-authenticated users

### 3. Analysis System
- Ready for integration with AI analysis
- Analysis results can be stored in Score model
- Resume analysis triggers and tracking

## Future Enhancements

### 1. AI Integration
- Resume parsing and content extraction
- Skills matching and gap analysis

- `MAX_FILE_SIZE`: Maximum file size in bytes (default: 10MB)
- `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS`: Allowed file extensions

### Database Configuration
- Uses existing database configuration
- Proper foreign key constraints
- Cascade delete for data integrity

## Error Handling
