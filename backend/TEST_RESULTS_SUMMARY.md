print(f"User roles: {user.get_role_names()}")
print(f"Is admin: {user.is_admin()}")
print(f"Has 'user' role: {user.has_role('user')}")
```

### **Manage Role Permissions:**
```python
role = await session.get(Role, role_id)
role.add_permission("new:permission")
role.remove_permission("old:permission")
await session.commit()
```

```python
assignment = UserRole(
    user_id=user.id,
    role_id=role.id,
    assigned_by=current_user.id,
    is_active=True
)
session.add(assignment)
await session.commit()
```
